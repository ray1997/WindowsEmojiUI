# This icon pack is no longer maintain

Reason: I'm just done with DBD

## The limitation of Emoji interpretation to Dead by Daylight
Here is all the limitation the emoji has that result in how you seen it now:

### No substitude

- Obsession

There’s nothing mean obsession in emoji, but from the look of it mostly encases the perk, So any emoji that circular and look fine when being a background should be 🏵

- Character face

There were several perks that use character face such as Flip-flop or Unbreakable. Sadly, no Bill or Ash Emoji. So, it has to be simplified to just face Emoji for now

- Generator

Printer emoji probably the closest thing to the generator. A machine, but the difference here is one provide electricity while the other don’t.

- Injured or sprawl 

Got to respect the Unicode how they really keep emoji PG, even 🔫 isn’t a gun but a toy. So, a result of violent such as cover in fear, injured, drop dead, or anything else related to person ill being in a harm way isn’t exist at all. As of that it should be replace with 🙇, or 🧎‍♂️

- Entity’s tentacle

Lots of perk has it, either spike or tantacle no emoji can describe it. So, some perk have to drop it, some of it usually involve in blocking, so road block should be an ok replacement (hopefully).

- Locker

I swear this is like the big stop obstacle that cause days haitus. There is no locker, container, or closet emoji. But in the end it become a football goal and later realize door is actually a better interpretation of locker. (Head on)

- Malee weapons

Despite the present of ⚾ and 🧤 there’s no baseball bat emoji. 🏒 is a replacement. (holy molly! is that the hockey reference!) I’m sure you can attack someone with it as good as baseball bat if you’re strong enough. (Turns out you can... Spoiler warning: Joel on The Last of Us 2 died from a hockey stick -_-‘)

- Medkit

There’s only a plaster and toolbox. No medkit or bandaid.


## How I made this?

With bunch of tools. Ofc.

1.	Photoshop to make the icon, export to PNG, adding effect, etc. 
2.	Character Maps UWP to extract high-resolution colored emoji from Segoe UI Emoji font. 
3.	emojipedia.org to search for emojis
4.	getemoji.com to get some emoji via screenshot that comes from a result of zero-width joiner (such as 👷‍♂️ (worker+male symbol), 🏳️‍🌈, etc.) 

## Why I did this?

To be honest, at first, I thought I was going to make perk pack using another font. “Segoe MDL2 Assets”, but only then I realize it very limited as most of them are tech and UI related. So, I turn to “Segoe UI Emoji” 

Also, another reason why is that I notice how little of a perk pack that interpret the icons to something else. Most pack I saw are adding background, border, or shades. As if the game itself wasn’t frustrating enough, now with icon change it should complicate and fueling the infuriate on loadout screen wondering where are those damn second chances perk are.
